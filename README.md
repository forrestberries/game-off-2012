## The Game

An (almost) exact copy of Cards Against Humanity.  The full instructions can be found [here](http://s3.amazonaws.com/cah/CAH_Rules.pdf). The main concept is that each player *pulls* cards from the pile and *pushes* the best card to complete the Card Czar's fill in the blank or question card.

The game requires a minimum of 3 players to play (2 to play, 1 czar) and has a maximum of.. well we never had more than about 10 people in a room.

Due to time constraints, it is missing a couple features from the original game.  There is no concept of gamblinb or a pick 2/3 black card.  And unfortunately there is no way to add rule modifiers as the original game instruction mentions.

There are over 500 white cards in the deck and more than 90 black cards.

## Future Plans
We fully intend to continue development on this game, as our original use case was that we wanted to be able to play Cards Against Humanity in a bar on our phones.
